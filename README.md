# EDA Miromiro cohort 

A slowly evolving project for our EDA cohort showing individual bios and actually a tasty selection of local beers!

In this implementation a knex database with a many-to-many relationship was set up between the two subjects and now working at linking classmates to their preferred beverage and vice-versa with users submitting comments as desired.

In time the site will allow ratings and likes as well as comments, and will add some coding quizzes and scoring for users to pit their wits against each other.
